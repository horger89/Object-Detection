# Object-Detection
Developed a project using InceptionResNet from TensorFlow Hub, implementing a Faster R-CNN object detection model. Trained on the COCO 2017 dataset with images scaled to 640x640, the model effectively detects 600 classes.

Suitable use cases
This model is suitable for localizing the most prominent objects in an image.

Unsuitable use cases
This model is unsuitable for standalone use in mission-critical applications such as obstacle and human detection for autonomous driving.
