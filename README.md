# Object-Detection
Developed a project using InceptionResNet from TensorFlow Hub, implementing a Faster R-CNN object detection model. Trained on the COCO 2017 dataset with images scaled to 640x640, the model effectively detects 600 classes.

Suitable use cases:

This model is suitable for localizing the most prominent objects in an image.

Unsuitable use cases:

This model is unsuitable for standalone use in mission-critical applications such as obstacle and human detection for autonomous driving.

To try out the model:

1. Open the notebook in Colab: Click the "Open in Colab" button located at the top of this file. This will launch the notebook in Google Colab's interactive environment.

2. Run the code cells: Navigate through the notebook and execute each code cell sequentially. You can do this by clicking the play button (▶️) or pressing Shift + Enter on each cell.

3. Upload your images: Once the necessary cells have run, you'll find a section near the bottom of the notebook where you can upload your own JPEG images for detection. Follow the provided instructions to select and upload your images.
